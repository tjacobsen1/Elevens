Buggy1: The deck was not created correctly, 

Buggy2: When the cards are created they are not added correctly into the ArrayList. It is a problem with Deck. 

Buggy3: It seems very similar to the "error" in Buggy2. It is a problem with the creatiion of the Deck and how the cards are being put into the ArrayList or something along those lines. 

Buggy4: The deck was not created correctly, just like Buggy1. The first card dealt is null for a 1 card deck.
